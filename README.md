# Resbot

## What is it?
**Resbot** is a learning project for Juho to learn coding basics for node.js and git. 

## What does it do?
Hopefully once completed it will enable a Discord bot to help people play the board game Resistance in Discord. The bot will be able to facilitate hidden role distribution to players, mission voting and resolving missions.

## How to install it (once it is complete)
- Install discord.js

```
$ npm install discord.js
```

- Create a new Discord application and add a bot to it (Google "create discord bot" for instructions if needed)

- Add config.json to the root of the application with the following content (replacing YOUR BOT TOKEN with the actual token of your Discord bot)

```
{
    "BOT_TOKEN": "YOUR BOT TOKEN"
}
```
